  <div class="post-content">
    <p>C++ is one of the most widely used programming languages in the world, 
and it is very flexible: Developers can work at the highest levels of 
abstraction, or at the processor level of the target architecture. 
C++ provides thoroughly optimized standard libraries, and enables 
access to low-level hardware features. C++ is used to develop games, 
spreadsheets, word processing software, embedded software, and other 
desktop applications, device drivers, high performance computing solutions, 
compilers and assemblers, web servers, mobile apps and operating systems.</p>

<p>C++ was created as an extension to the C programming language, which 
allows the use of raw pointers, arrays, null-terminated character strings, 
and many other features that enable great performance, but can also be a 
source of serious bugs that are hard to detect.</p>

<p>As C++ has evolved, the need to use C-style idioms has diminished, but
the old C-programming facilities are still there when you need them.
Backwards compatibility has always been a big thing for the C++ community,
as this protects the investments made by companies and organizations all
over the world into developing vast and complex software solutions.</p>

<p>Modern C++ tool chains are significantly more secure than before, providing
features such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Static analyzers, implemented using path-sensitive, inter-procedural 
analysis based on symbolic execution techniques, including:
    <ul>
      <li>Thread safety analysis as a C++ language extension which warns about 
potential race conditions in code.</li>
      <li>Warnings emitted at compile time to help developers update their code 
to encapsulate and propagate the bounds information associated with pointers.</li>
      <li>Runtime assertions that eliminate undefined behavior as long as the coding 
convention is followed and the bounds information is therefore available and 
correct.</li>
      <li><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/code-quality/using-sal-annotations-to-reduce-c-cpp-code-defects">SAL annotations</a>
used to enhance static code analysis.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Runtime sanitizers like:
    <ul>
      <li>AddressSanitizer which is a fast memory error detector consisting of a compiler 
instrumentation module and a run-time library. It can detect bugs like:
        <ul>
          <li>Out-of-bounds accesses to heap, stack and global variables.</li>
          <li>Use-after-free.</li>
          <li>Use-after-return.</li>
          <li>Use-after-scope.</li>
          <li>Double-free, invalid free.</li>
          <li>Memory leaks.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>ThreadSanitizer which detects data races.</li>
      <li>MemorySanitizer which detects uninitialized memory use such as:
        <ul>
          <li>Uninitialized value used in a conditional branch.</li>
          <li>Uninitialized pointer used for memory accesses.</li>
          <li>Uninitialized value was passed or returned from a function call.</li>
          <li>Uninitialized data was passed to a system call.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer which detects:
        <ul>
          <li>Array subscript out of bounds, where the bounds can be statically determined.</li>
          <li>Bitwise shifts that are out of bounds for their data type.</li>
          <li>Dereferencing misaligned or null pointers.</li>
          <li>Signed integer overflow.</li>
          <li>Conversion to, from, or between floating-point types which would overflow the destination</li>
          <li>and <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html">more</a>.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>None of the above helps if it is not used, and these features are being actively developed and
enhanced, and the latest version of the C++ tool chains offers significant enhancements over the
previous versions.</p>

<p>These features are generally something developers must actively enable for the
code base they are working on, and this often requires a significant effort, 
as the static analyzers often favors modern C++ idioms and certain coding conventions, 
which is good as they are far less error prone. This means that the code base 
may need modification to get as much mileage out of the tools as possible. Still, 
this should be much cheaper than rewriting the entire code base in another 
programming language.</p>

<p>These tools cannot be proven to catch all potential errors in C and C++ code, but when used rigorously
in conjunction with unit tests and integrations tests, they are able to catch most of the bugs they are 
designed to detect.</p>
